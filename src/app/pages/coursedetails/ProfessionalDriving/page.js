By being aware of potential hazards and anticipating the actions of other drivers, a defensive driver is better prepared to avoid accidents and minimize the risks of driving. Defensive driving techniques are especially important in todayâ€™s fast-paced and unpredictable driving environment, where distractions and aggressive driving are common." contentParaSecond="One of the key principles of defensive driving is maintaining a safe following distance. By keeping a safe distance from the vehicle in front, a driver has more time to react to sudden stops or maneuvers, reducing the risk of rear-end collisions. Another important principle is scanning the road ahead for potential hazards, such as pedestrians, other vehicles, or road debris. By being aware of these hazards, a driver can anticipate potential dangers and take steps to avoid them." Price="$150.00" />
